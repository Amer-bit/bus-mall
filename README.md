created index.html, style.css, app.js, .gitignore, and .eslintrc.json
build the constructor for the 20 object which was used from an array of strings and pushed them in another array of object
then created a function to pick random three objects to display them on the user screen. To display them i used addEventListner to generate more three random picture for 25 guesses and after 25 votes i stoped the eventlistener and invoked a results function to render the result.
